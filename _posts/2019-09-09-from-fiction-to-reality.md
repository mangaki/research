Here are a few examples.

## Melon Cream Soda in Haruhi Suzumiya

In [this recorded talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x49PpyxNoEw) from Yoshiya Makita et al. from Ritsumeikan University at the [research symposium of Anime Expo 2017](https://www.animemangastudies.com/symposium/anime-and-manga-studies-symposium-2017/), we learn that:

- The Haruhi Suzumiya series are based on [real-life locations in Nishinomiya](https://haruhi.info/map2019/index.html) (halfway between Kobe and Osaka).
- Even the café in which Yuki orders a Melon Cream Soda [exists in real life](https://goo.gl/maps/x1pRshpk8LTeLkwh8) (although it has moved from the original location).
- The Melon Cream Soda was not originally available there, but presumably due to pressure from fans, it is now part of the menu.

That's the whole point: from fiction it became reality.

## Uniforms from Kyoto Kogakuin High School

Back in 2016 when Mangaki received a prize from the Japan Foundation in Paris, the vice-president of [Kyoto Manga Museum](https://www.kyotomm.jp/english/) told us that they were struggling to make manga culture accepted in Japan (not as a subculture). He had such an example of fiction that becomes reality:

- Kyoto Kogakuin High School wanted to increase their girl rate.
- They got inspired from a manga called *Taihen Yoku Dekimashita* (*Well Done*) and changed their uniforms to match the ones from the manga.
- Did it worked? I don't know, but it got covered by many media in Japan.
