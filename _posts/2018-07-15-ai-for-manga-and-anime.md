- [Crypko](https://crypko.ai) – [White paper](https://crypko.ai/static/files/crypko-whitepaper.pdf)

> *Make.Girls.Moe got 1 million views the first 10 days. Our research proceedings were quickly sold out at the Comic Market #92 (Tokyo) in Summer 2017.*

Here is an example of what can be achieved using GANs to generate anime characters.

## Using Posters to recommend anime and mangas

**Mangaki**, a anime/manga recommender system presented by Jill-Jênn Vie from RIKEN AIP, Tokyo.

Everyone regularly ask themselves what movie, series or book they should watch next, according to their taste. [Mangaki](https://mangaki.fr) is a award-winning website that innovates access to Japanese culture through a recommender system. When a user shows up, our algorithm asks them to rate a few works. Based on their answers, they receive a personalized to-watch list of anime & manga, by geometrically positioning their ratings within those collected from other users, and using deep learning to extract information from manga covers or anime posters.

> *Mangaki gathered 330k ratings from 2,000 people over 11,000 anime & manga works. In Summer 2017, we released them for a [data challenge](/2017/07/18/mangaki-data-challenge-en/) organized by Kyoto University that attracted [31 submissions](/2017/10/08/mangaki-data-challenge-winners-en/) from 11 countries. Mangaki was awarded the first prize by the Japan Foundation (Paris branch), and an open source award by Microsoft Ventures.*
